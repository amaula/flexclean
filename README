* flexclean - v1.0
Copyright (C) 2012 - Antti Maula

Simple python script to clean up outdated 'timestamped' files created by the
flexbackup software. Without any parameters, the script will search thecurrent
working directory for all files with postfix'*.tar'. The files found are then
matched against a regular expression, which will split the filenames in three
parts: prefix, level and timestamp. The filenames are then grouped by prefix,
then by level and finally ordered by timestamp inside each group. After all
this, the selected number of 'oldest' files per level are selected for
deletion. Before deleting anything, the script requires the user to write a
word 'confirm', after which it will delete all files listed to be deleted.
